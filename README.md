## What is Pacifist?

Pacifist is a professional-grade application designed for macOS that enables users to explore, analyze, and extract files from various types of installer packages and archives. Whether you are dealing with a .pkg, .dmg, .xip, or .zip file, Pacifist provides a clear view of all contained files and metadata, allowing for precise control over what gets installed or restored.

This tool is invaluable for software developers, IT professionals, and advanced users who need to audit installer contents, recover specific resources, or troubleshoot installation issues. Pacifist can also check file integrity, compare package versions, and install items directly to the system without running the full installer—saving time and reducing risks.

The application is built for performance and compatibility, supporting the latest macOS releases including Sonoma and Ventura, and optimized for both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures. Its straightforward interface ensures that even complex tasks are accessible to users of all skill levels.
